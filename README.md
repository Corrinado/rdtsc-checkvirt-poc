## Synopsis
This repository contains papers, explaining the new virtualization test attack based on meltdown. They are not extensive in any way, and provide just a limited explanation, without diving too deep into details.
## Code samples
This repository provides POC code for windows, linux and mac os. However they were tested on a limited number of distirbutions, so there can be problems with compilation and call convention on some distributions.
## Authors
This vulnerability was found by Innokenty Sennovsky. Special thanks to Alexander Salikov for help with testing and POCs.
