## Synopsis
Hypervisor detection using speculative execution
## Contents
This repository contains papers explaining the new virtualization test attack based on Meltdown. They are not extensive in any way and provide just a limited explanation without diving too deep into details.
## Code samples
This repository provides PoC code for Windows, Linux and macOS. However, it was tested on a limited number of distirbutions, so there can be problems with compilation and call convention on some distributions.
## Authors
This vulnerability was found by Innokentiy Sennovskiy. Special thanks to Alexander Salikov for the help with testing and PoCs.
